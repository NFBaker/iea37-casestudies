	Abstract = {The purpose of the proposed IEA Task is to coordinate international research activities, towards the analysis of wind power plants as holistic systems.  To fully assess how a change, or an uncertainty, in a design parameter affects the myriad of objectives in system performance and cost, a holistic and integrated approach is needed. Integrated systems research, design and development (RD&D) can provide opportunities for improvements in overall system performance, and reduction in the levelized cost of energy. However,  there are significant challenges to developing such integrated approaches, both within and across organizations. There is a need to explore both the opportunities and the challenges for applying systems engineering to integrated wind energy RD&D across the entire wind energy system. This need surfaces both in the tools and methods used in wind plant RD&D.},

	Abstract = {The aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbine wakes is studied. The contents is directed towards the physics of power extraction by wind turbines and reviews both the near and the far wake region. For the near wake, the survey is restricted to uniform, steady and parallel flow conditions, thereby excluding wind shear, wind speed and rotor setting changes and yawed conditions. The emphasis is put on measurements in controlled conditions. For the far wake, the survey focusses on both single turbines and wind farm effects, and the experimental and numerical workare reviewed; the main interest is to study how the far wake decays downstream, in order to estimate the effect produced in downstream turbines. The article is further restricted to horizontal axis wind turbines and excludes all other types of turbines.},

@techreport{Soren2011,
	Abstract = {This report describes the development of a fast and reasonably accurate model for the prediction of energy production in offshore wind farms taking wake effects into account.
The model has been implemented as a windows application called Fuga which can run in
batch mode or as a graphical user interface. Fuga is briefly described. The model is based
on alinearization technique which is described in some detail, and linearized, governing
equations are derived and written in a standard form based on a mixed-spectral formulation.
A new solution method is used to solve the equations which involves intensive use of look-up
tables for storage of intermediate results. Due to the linearity of the model, multiple wakes
from many turbines can be constructed from the wake of a single, solitary turbine. These
are in turn constructed from Fourier components by a fast Fourier integral transform of
results derived from generic look-up tables. Three different models, based on three different
closures, are examined:
- the 'simple closure' using an unperturbed eddy viscosity uz
- the mixing length closure
- the E-e closure
Model results are evaluated against offshore wind farm production data from Horns Rev I
and the Nysted wind farm, and a comparison with direct wake measurements in an onshore
turbine (Nibe B) is also made. A very satisfactory agreement with data is found for the simple
closure. The exception is the near wake, just behind the rotor, where all three linearized
models fail. The mixing length closure underestimates wake effects in all cases. The E-e
closure overestimates wake losses in the offshore farms while it predicts a too shallow and
too wide the wake in the onshore case. The simple closure performs distinctly better than the
other two. Wind speed data from the the Horns rev met masts are used to further validate
Fuga results with the 'simple' closure.
Finally, Rdsand 1 and 2 are used as an example to illustrate the interaction between
wind farms.},

	Abstract = {Wind farm power production is known to be strongly affected by turbine wake effects. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a new analytical model for the prediction of wind turbine wakes and the associated power losses in wind farms. The new model is an extension of the one recently proposed by Bastankhah and Port{\'e}-Agel for the wake of stand-alone wind turbines. It satisfies the conservation of mass and momentum and assumes a self-similar  aussian shape of the velocity deficit. The local wake growth rate is estimated based on the local streamwise turbulence intensity. Superposition of velocity deficits is used to model the interaction of the multiple wakes. Furthermore, the power production from the wind turbines is calculated using the power curve. The performance of the new analytical wind farm model is validated against power measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data from the Horns Rev wind farm for a wide range of wind directions, corresponding to a variety of full-wake and partial-wake conditions. A reasonable agreement is found between the proposed analytical model, LES data, and power measurements. Compared with a commonly used wind farm wake},

	Abstract = {This work is dedicated to systematically studying and predicting the wake characteristics of a yawed wind turbine immersed in a turbulent boundary layer. To achieve this goal, wind tunnel experiments were performed to characterize the wake of a horizontal-axis wind turbine model. A high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system was used to measure the three velocity components in the turbine wake under different yaw angles and tip-speed ratios. Moreover, power and thrust measurements were carried out to analyse the performance of the wind turbine. These detailed wind tunnel measurements were then used to perform a budget study of the continuity and Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations for the wake of a yawed turbine. This theoretical analysis revealed some notable features of the wakes of yawed turbines, such as the asymmetric distribution of the wake skew angle with respect to the wake centre. Under highly yawed conditions, the formation of a counter-rotating vortex pair in the wake cross-section as well as the vertical displacement of the wake centre were shown and analysed. Finally, this study enabled us to develop general governing equations upon which a simple and computationally inexpensive analytical model was built. The proposed model aims at predicting the wake deflection and the far-wake velocity distribution for yawed turbines. Comparisons of model predictions with the wind tunnel measurements show that this simple model can acceptably predict the velocity distribution in the far wake of a yawed turbine. Apart from the ability of the model to predict wake flows in yawed conditions, it can provide valuable physical insight on the behaviour of turbine wakes in this complex situation.},

The model is derived by applying conservation of mass and momentum and assuming a Gaussian distribution for the velocity deficit in the wake. This simple model only requires one parameter to determine the velocity distribution in the wake. The results are compared to highresolution wind-tunnel measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data of miniature windturbine wakes, as well as LES data of real-scale wind-turbine wakes. In general, it is found that the velocity deficit in the wake predicted by the proposed analytical model is in good agreement with the experimental and LES data. The results also show that the new model predicts the power extracted by downwind wind turbines more accurately than other common analytical models, some of which are based on less accurate assumptions like considering a top-hat shape for the velocity deficit.},

This paper provides details on the recent changes made to the FLORIS model to make the model more suitable for gradient-based optimization. Changes to the FLORIS model were made to remove discontinuities and add curvature to regions of non-physical zero gradient. Exact gradients for the FLORIS model were obtained using algorithmic differentiation. A set of three case studies demonstrate that using exact gradients with gradient-based optimization reduces the number of function calls by several orders of magnitude. The case studies also show that adding curvature improves convergence behavior, allowing the FLORIS model to more reliably find better solutions to wind farm optimization problems.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a wind plant control strategy that optimizes the yaw settings of wind turbines for improved energy production of the whole wind plant by taking into account wake effects. The optimization controller is based on a novel internal parametric model for wake effects called the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-state (FLORIS) model. The FLORIS model predicts the steady-state wake locations and the effective flow velocities at each turbine, and the resulting turbine electrical energy production levels, as a function of the axial induction and the yaw angle of the different rotors. The FLORIS model has a limited number of parameters that are estimated based on turbine electrical power production data. In high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of a small wind plant, we demonstrate that the optimization control based on the FLORIS model increases the energy production of the wind plant, with a reduction of loads on the turbines as an additional effect.

	Abstract = {The wind farm layout optimization problem has received considerable attention over the past two decades. The objective of this problem is to determine the wind farm layout that maximizes the annual energy generated. The majority of studies that have solved this problem simulated the velocity deficit using the Jensen wake model. However, this model is not in agreement with field measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulations. In this study, an approach to solve the wind farm layout optimization problem based on a Gaussian wake model is proposed. The Gaussian wake model uses an exponential function to evaluate the velocity deficit, in contrast to the Jensen wake model that assumes a uniform velocity profile inside the wake. The proposed approach minimizes the annual cost of energy of a wind farm using a genetic algorithm. The application of the proposed approach yields higher annual generation and a lower computational time for all wind scenarios under study. Under a more complex wind scenario, the improvement was relatively small. This suggests that the use of a more robust wake model in the WFLO problem, does not lead to greater efficiency in real wind cases.},

@techreport{Larsen2009,
	Abstract = {We present an idealized simple, but fast, semi-analytical algorithm for computation of
stationary wind farm wind fields with a possible potential within a multi-fidelity strategy for wind farm topology optimization.
Basically, the model considers wakes as linear perturbations
on the ambient non-uniform mean wind field, although the
modelling of the individual stationary wake flow fields
includes non-linear terms. The simulation of the individual
wake contributions are based on an analytical solution of the
thin shear layer approximation of the NS equations. The wake
flow fields are assumed rotationally symmetric, and the rotor
inflow fields are consistently assumed uniform.
Expansion of stationary wake fields is believed to be
significantly affected by meandering of wake deficits as e.g.
described by the Dynamic Wake Meandering model. In the
present context, this effect is approximately accounted for by
imposing suitable empirical downstream boundary conditions
on the wake expansion that depend on the rotor thrust and the
ambient turbulence conditions, respectively. For downstream
distances beyond approximately 10 rotor diameters (at which
distance the calibrated wake expansion boundary conditions
are imposed), the present formulation of wake expansion is
believed to underestimate wake expansion, because the
analytical wake formulation dictates the wake expansion to
behave as x^(1/3) with downstream distance, whereas wake
expansion as primary controlled by wake meandering
develops approximately linearly with the downstream
distance.
The link from a non-uniform wind farm wind field,
consisting of linear perturbations on the ambient non-uniform
mean wind field, to a fictitious uniform wake generating
inflow field is established using two different averaging
approaches -- a linear and a non-linear. With each of these
approached, a parabolic system are described, which is
initiated by first considering the most upwind located turbines
and subsequently successively solved in the downstream
direction. Algorithms for the resulting wind farm flow fields
are proposed, and it is shown that in the limit of very large
downstream distances, the simulated field is shown to recover
to the undisturbed ambient wind field upstream the wind farm.},

The mechanism described above accounts for the extraction of kinetic energy but in
no way explains what happens to that energy; it may well be put to useful work but
some may be spilled back into the wind as turbulence and eventually be dissipated
as heat. Nevertheless, we can begin an analysis of the aerodynamic behaviour of
wind turbines without any specific turbine design just by considering the energy
extraction process. The general device that carries out this task is called an actuator
disc (Figure 3.2).

Firstly, two introductory chapters are devoted to the physics of the flow around a wind turbine and the existing engineering models for blade and wake aerodynamics. The focus of this work is however on the numerical modeling of wakes. The difficulties in solving the Navier-Stokes equations are discussed, and the different existing models for the description of the rotor and the wake are mentioned, along with problems associated with the choice of turbulence models and inflow conditions. The purpose of this overview is to include the latest developments in the numerical computation of wind turbine aerodynamics.},
	Annote = {During the last decades more and more wind turbines have been installed in large wind farms. The grouping of turbines in such a farm introduces two major issues: a wind turbine operating in the wake of another turbine has a reduced power production (because of a lower incident wind speed) and shortens the lifetime of the rotors (because of an increased turbulence intensity) [11]. For example, Neustadter and Spera [53] found a reduction of 10% in power output for three turbines separated by 7 rotor diameters; Elliott mentions in his review [22] a `considerable reduction in efficiency' and `[the windfarm] produced substantially less energy'. For full wake conditions power losses of downstreamturbines can be 30-40%, but when averaged over different wind directions, losses of 5-8% have been reported [4, 5].

	Abstract = {This article presents a review of the state of the art of the Wind Farm Design and Optimization (WFDO) problem. The WFDO problem refers to a set of advanced planning actions needed to extremize the performance of wind farms, which may be composed of a few individual Wind Turbines (WTs) up to thousands of WTs. The WFDO problem has been investigated in different scenarios, with substantial differences in main objectives, modelling assumptions, constraints, and numerical solution methods. The aim of this paper is: (1) to present an exhaustive survey of the literature covering the full span of the subject, an analysis of the state-of-the-art models describing the performance of wind farms as well as its extensions, and the numerical approaches used to solve the problem; (2) to provide an overview of the available knowledge and recent progress in the application of such strategies to real onshore and offshore wind farms; and (3) to propose a comprehensive
agenda for future research.},
	Annote = {The first scientific works related to the interactions of Wind Turbines (WTs) in arrays appeared in 1974 [4--10], marking the beginning of successive paradigm shifts in WT wake (see Section 2.2.1 for a detailed description) modeling and WT array layout optimization. The interactions between WTs through wakes were initially modelled as an equivalent increase in surface roughness which modified the Earth's boundary layer due to the WT-induced drag. Based on this coarse wake-interaction modeling, it was concluded that quite large separations between WTs were required to avoid significant wake-based energy losses. In the subsequent years, staggered equally-spaced (or grid-like) siting schemes were slowly adopted as a rule-of-thumb by wind farm designers [11--17]. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, just after the construction of the world's first electricity-generating wind farm in New Hampshire (USA) in 1980, the first engineering wake models [18--24], mostly based on flow momentum conservation and linearized far wake expansion assumptions (with the notable exception of the Larsen [25] and Ainslie [26] models), appeared, laying the groundwork for the first study on Wind Farm Design and Optimization (WFDO) [27], which aimed at optimizing the spacing between WTs in a linear array by using a generalized reduced gradient method that maximized the total power conversion of the array. The maximum achieved increase in power conversion for the given generic study case was 1.29% compared to an equally-spaced linear array. At first glance, this might appear to be a poor improvement, however, a mere one percent improvement in electricity output would result in large additional revenues over the typical 20-year lifetime of wind farms.},

	Abstract = {   Wind power is one of the fastest growing sources of new electricity generation in the United States. Cumulative installed capacity was more than 74,000 megawatts (MW) at year-end 2015 and wind power supplied 4.7% of total 2015 U.S. electricity generation. Despite the growth of the wind power industry, the distributed wind market has remained limited. Cumulative installations of distributed wind through 2015 totaled 934 MW. This first-of-a-kind exploratory analysis characterizes the future opportunity for behind-the-meter distributed wind, serving primarily rural or suburban homes, farms, and manufacturing facilities.
   This work focuses only on the grid-connected, behind-the-meter subset of the broader distributed wind market. We estimate this segment to be approximately half of the 934 MW of total installed distributed wind capacity at year-end 2015. Potential from other distributed wind market segments including systems installed in front of the meter (e.g., community wind) and in remote, off-grid locations is not assessed in this analysis and therefore, would be additive to results presented here. These other distributed wind market segments are not considered in this initial effort because of their relatively unique economic and market attributes.
   Opportunities for behind-the-meter distributed wind are considered from three perspectives: addressable resource potential, economic potential, and market potential. The first of these perspectives is intended to frame the overall scale of the opportunity2; the second quantifies the potential capacity of systems that could generate a positive net present value (NPV) at a specific point in time; the third considers economics as well as consumer adoption behaviors to estimate potential deployment levels for the specific conditions assessed.
For addressable resource potential, we identify a single estimate for all theoretical behind-the-meter distributed wind applications. We use scenarios or an array of future conditions to more fully explore economic and market potential. Variables in our scenarios include capital and operation and maintenance costs, technology performance, the value of distributed generation, system financing and leasing costs, consumer adoption rates, and siting criteria. More details on the scenario framework including the Combined scenarios as well as explicit Low, Reference, High, and Breakthrough values are provided in Section 1.1.
   Consistent with prior distributed generation analyses conducted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and as a first assessment of the opportunity for behind-the-meter distributed wind, this work does not consider potential competition from alternative distributed-generation sources such as rooftop solar photovoltaics, assumes federal and state tax incentives and renewable portfolio standards as legislated, and may not capture all costs of integration into the distribution network. Also, consistent with prior work, net metering and siting setbacks are varied within the range of existing policies today.},
	Address = {15013 Denver West Parkway, Golden, CO 80401},
	Annote = {5.2 Results and Discussion
   Applying the consumer adoption data and parameters described above, market potential, as measured by cumulative installed behind-the-meter capacity and based on the Reference scenario inputs, is estimated at 1.5 GW in 2030 and 3.7 GW in 2050 (Figure 21). Assuming behind-the-meter applications are about half of today's total installed distributed wind capacity (approximately 500 MW), which represents an approximate 300% increase in the market by 2030 and an approximate eight-fold increase or three doublings of cumulative behind-the-meter capacity by 2050. Although the economics are anticipated to improve and growth rates are nontrivial under a generally business-as-usual approach, the trajectory for behind-the-meter distributed wind is largely consistent with recent historical trends.

   1. Documentation of the current state of wind power in the United States and identification of key technological accomplishments and societal benefits over the decade leading up to 2014;
   2. Exploration of the potential pathways for wind power to contribute to the future electricity needs of the nation, including objectives such as reduced carbon emissions, improved air quality, and reduced water use;
   3. Quantification of costs, benefits, and other impacts associated with continued deployment and growth of U.S. wind power; and
   4. Identification of actions and future achievements that could support continued growth in the use and application of wind-generated electricity.
   The conclusions of this collaborative effort demonstrate the important role that wind power has in the U.S. power sector and highlight its potential to continue to provide clean, reliable and affordable electricity to consumers for decades to come. The Wind Vision study does not evaluate nor recommend policy actions, but analyzes feasibility, costs, and benefits of increased wind power deployment to inform policy decisions at the federal, state, tribal, and local levels.},

   Certain factors combine to set the atmosphere in motion, but a
major factor is the uneven heating of the Earth's surface. This
heating upsets the equilibrium of the atmosphere, creating
changes in air movement and atmospheric pressure. The
movement of air around the surface of the Earth is called
atmospheric circulation.
   Heating of the Earth's surface is accomplished by several
processes, but in the simple convection-only model used for
this discussion, the Earth is warmed by energy radiating from
the sun. The process causes a circular motion that results
when warm air rises and is replaced by cooler air.
   Warm air rises because heat causes air molecules to spread
apart. As the air expands, it becomes less dense and lighter
than the surrounding air. As air cools, the molecules pack
together more closely, becoming denser and heavier than
warm air. As a result, cool, heavy air tends to sink and replace
warmer, rising air."
