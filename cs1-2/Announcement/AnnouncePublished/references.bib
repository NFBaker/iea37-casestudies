	Abstract = {We present an idealized simple, but fast, semi-analytical algorithm for computation of
stationary wind farm wind fields with a possible potential within a multi-fidelity strategy for wind farm topology optimization.
Basically, the model considers wakes as linear perturbations
on the ambient non-uniform mean wind field, although the
modelling of the individual stationary wake flow fields
includes non-linear terms. The simulation of the individual
wake contributions are based on an analytical solution of the
thin shear layer approximation of the NS equations. The wake
flow fields are assumed rotationally symmetric, and the rotor
inflow fields are consistently assumed uniform.
Expansion of stationary wake fields is believed to be
significantly affected by meandering of wake deficits as e.g.
described by the Dynamic Wake Meandering model. In the
present context, this effect is approximately accounted for by
imposing suitable empirical downstream boundary conditions
on the wake expansion that depend on the rotor thrust and the
ambient turbulence conditions, respectively. For downstream
distances beyond approximately 10 rotor diameters (at which
distance the calibrated wake expansion boundary conditions
are imposed), the present formulation of wake expansion is
believed to underestimate wake expansion, because the
analytical wake formulation dictates the wake expansion to
behave as x^(1/3) with downstream distance, whereas wake
expansion as primary controlled by wake meandering
develops approximately linearly with the downstream
distance.
The link from a non-uniform wind farm wind field,
consisting of linear perturbations on the ambient non-uniform
mean wind field, to a fictitious uniform wake generating
inflow field is established using two different averaging
approaches -- a linear and a non-linear. With each of these
approached, a parabolic system are described, which is
initiated by first considering the most upwind located turbines
and subsequently successively solved in the downstream
direction. Algorithms for the resulting wind farm flow fields
are proposed, and it is shown that in the limit of very large
downstream distances, the simulated field is shown to recover
to the undisturbed ambient wind field upstream the wind farm.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a review of the state of the art of the Wind Farm Design and Optimization (WFDO) problem. The WFDO problem refers to a set of advanced planning actions needed to extremize the performance of wind farms, which may be composed of a few individual Wind Turbines (WTs) up to thousands of WTs. The WFDO problem has been investigated in different scenarios, with substantial differences in main objectives, modelling assumptions, constraints, and numerical solution methods. The aim of this paper is: (1) to present an exhaustive survey of the literature covering the full span of the subject, an analysis of the state-of-the-art models describing the performance of wind farms as well as its extensions, and the numerical approaches used to solve the problem; (2) to provide an overview of the available knowledge and recent progress in the application of such strategies to real onshore and offshore wind farms; and (3) to propose a comprehensive
agenda for future research.},
	Annote = {The first scientific works related to the interactions of Wind Turbines (WTs) in arrays appeared in 1974 [4--10], marking the beginning of successive paradigm shifts in WT wake (see Section 2.2.1 for a detailed description) modeling and WT array layout optimization. The interactions between WTs through wakes were initially modelled as an equivalent increase in surface roughness which modified the Earth's boundary layer due to the WT-induced drag. Based on this coarse wake-interaction modeling, it was concluded that quite large separations between WTs were required to avoid significant wake-based energy losses. In the subsequent years, staggered equally-spaced (or grid-like) siting schemes were slowly adopted as a rule-of-thumb by wind farm designers [11--17]. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, just after the construction of the world's first electricity-generating wind farm in New Hampshire (USA) in 1980, the first engineering wake models [18--24], mostly based on flow momentum conservation and linearized far wake expansion assumptions (with the notable exception of the Larsen [25] and Ainslie [26] models), appeared, laying the groundwork for the first study on Wind Farm Design and Optimization (WFDO) [27], which aimed at optimizing the spacing between WTs in a linear array by using a generalized reduced gradient method that maximized the total power conversion of the array. The maximum achieved increase in power conversion for the given generic study case was 1.29% compared to an equally-spaced linear array. At first glance, this might appear to be a poor improvement, however, a mere one percent improvement in electricity output would result in large additional revenues over the typical 20-year lifetime of wind farms.},

	Abstract = {Wind farm power production is known to be strongly affected by turbine wake effects. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a new analytical model for the prediction of wind turbine wakes and the associated power losses in wind farms. The new model is an extension of the one recently proposed by Bastankhah and Port{\'e}-Agel for the wake of stand-alone wind turbines. It satisfies the conservation of mass and momentum and assumes a self-similar  aussian shape of the velocity deficit. The local wake growth rate is estimated based on the local streamwise turbulence intensity. Superposition of velocity deficits is used to model the interaction of the multiple wakes. Furthermore, the power production from the wind turbines is calculated using the power curve. The performance of the new analytical wind farm model is validated against power measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data from the Horns Rev wind farm for a wide range of wind directions, corresponding to a variety of full-wake and partial-wake conditions. A reasonable agreement is found between the proposed analytical model, LES data, and power measurements. Compared with a commonly used wind farm wake},

	Abstract = {A new analytical wake model is proposed and validated to predict the wind velocity distribution downwind of a wind turbine. The model is derived by applying conservation of mass and momentum and assuming a Gaussian distribution for the velocity deficit in the wake. This simple model only requires one parameter to determine the velocity distribution in the wake. The results are compared to highresolution wind-tunnel measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data of miniature windturbine wakes, as well as LES data of real-scale wind-turbine wakes. In general, it is found that the velocity deficit in the wake predicted by the proposed analytical model is in good agreement with the experimental and LES data. The results also show that the new model predicts the power extracted by downwind wind turbines more accurately than other common analytical models, some of which are based on less accurate assumptions like considering a top-hat shape for the velocity deficit.},

	Abstract = {This work is dedicated to systematically studying and predicting the wake characteristics of a yawed wind turbine immersed in a turbulent boundary layer. To achieve this goal, wind tunnel experiments were performed to characterize the wake of a horizontal-axis wind turbine model. A high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system was used to measure the three velocity components in the turbine wake under different yaw angles and tip-speed ratios. Moreover, power and thrust measurements were carried out to analyse the performance of the wind turbine. These detailed wind tunnel measurements were then used to perform a budget study of the continuity and Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations for the wake of a yawed turbine. This theoretical analysis revealed some notable features of the wakes of yawed turbines, such as the asymmetric distribution of the wake skew angle with respect to the wake centre. Under highly yawed conditions, the formation of a counter-rotating vortex pair in the wake cross-section as well as the vertical displacement of the wake centre were shown and analysed. Finally, this study enabled us to develop general governing equations upon which a simple and computationally inexpensive analytical model was built. The proposed model aims at predicting the wake deflection and the far-wake velocity distribution for yawed turbines. Comparisons of model predictions with the wind tunnel measurements show that this simple model can acceptably predict the velocity distribution in the far wake of a yawed turbine. Apart from the ability of the model to predict wake flows in yawed conditions, it can provide valuable physical insight on the behaviour of turbine wakes in this complex situation.},
