	\textbf{This paper presents the results of two discrete case studies regarding the Wind Farm Layout Optimization (WFLO) problem.
		Case study (1) considers variations in optimization strategies for a simplified Bastankhah Gaussian wake model, while case study (2) studies trade offs in performance with variation in both physics model and optimization strategy selection.
		For (1), a supplied wake model outputs Annual Energy Production (AEP) given participant input turbine locations.
		For (2), participants calculate AEP using a wake model of their choice, while also implementing their preferred optimization method.
		Participant submissions for optimized turbine locations were then compared to Large Eddy Simulator (LES) calculations for AEP, and results were measured for both quality and accuracy.
		%Initial results for (1) show gradient-based methods, on average, superior to gradient-free methods in terms of convergence time and resultant AEP.
		%Initial results for (2) show a pattern of linear turbine placement due to the permissive width of the wind farm given the turbine diameter and minimum spacing constraint.
		%More participant data will be needed to see if trends seen in preliminary results are indicative of broader patters, or are anachronistic due to the smallness of the sample size.
