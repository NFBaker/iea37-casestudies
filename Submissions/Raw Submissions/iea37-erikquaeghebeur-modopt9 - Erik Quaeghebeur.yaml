title: IEA Wind Task 37 Combined Case Study 9 Turbine Farm
description: >-
  Result file of Erik Quaeghebeur using his ‘full’ pseudo-gradient approach
  starting from a hand-picked layout using the following parameters:
  * 100 model call cutoff,
  * scale_multiplier = 1.02,
  * step_scaler = 5 * farm_radius / n
  * interleaving m=-6, so 1 crosswind step followed by 5 pushdown+pushback steps
